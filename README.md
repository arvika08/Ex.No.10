# **Ex. No. 10 – Content Creation (Reports, articles, case studies etc) Using Prompt Patterns**

## **Aim**

To demonstrate how prompting techniques—query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, semantic filtering, fact-checking, and tail generation—can be used to create high-quality content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative writing using AI tools.

---

## **Procedure**

### **1. Introduction to Prompt Patterns**

* **Query Decomposition:** Break complex tasks into smaller parts.
* **Decision Making:** Let the model choose between options.
* **Answer Engineering:** Shape structure, tone, depth, and format.
* **Fact-Check List:** Improve accuracy for reports/case studies.
* **Tail Generation:** Extend narratives or analyses logically.
* **Menu Actions:** Provide options and guide model decisions.
* **Semantic Filtering:** Control tone (formal, creative, narrative, etc.).

---

### **2. Choosing the Content Type**

Selected two content types from the list:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends**
2. **Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

---

### **3. Creating the Prompts**

#### **Basic Prompts (First Drafts)**

* **Business Report:**

  ```
  Write a basic report on current global market trends.
  ```

* **Sci-Fi Story:**

  ```
  Write a short sci-fi story set in the future.
  ```

#### **Refined Prompts (Using Prompt Patterns)**

* **Query Decomposition:**

  ```
  Break the report into introduction, data trends, analysis, risks, and predictions.
  ```

* **Decision Making:**

  ```
  Choose one sector—technology, healthcare, or energy—and focus the analysis on it.
  ```

* **Semantic Filtering:**

  ```
  Write the story in a cinematic tone with emotional depth.
  ```

* **Tail Generation:**

  ```
  Extend the story by adding a twist ending revealing a hidden truth.
  ```

* **Answer Engineering:**

  ```
  Present the report using headings, bullet points, and a summary.
  ```

## **Test Case Scenario 2: Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

### **First Draft**

```
In the year 2300, humans explored distant planets. A pilot found a strange signal.
```

### **Refined Story (Using Prompt Patterns)**

#### **Title: The Last Signal**

In 2300, Captain Mira Patel journeyed through the Orion Belt aboard *Starlight-9*.
A mysterious signal pulsed like a heartbeat through her ship’s sensors.

Following it, she discovered a floating metallic sphere transmitting an ancient Earth message.

**Tail Generation Applied:**
The message was a **warning**—recorded by humans from a parallel future where Earth had collapsed.

The sphere unfolded like a blooming metal flower, revealing holograms of a future war. Mira realized the signal was not a threat—but a *second chance*.

She set a new course back to Earth.
The future would change because she chose to listen.

## **Review and Evaluation**

| Parameter        | Findings                                                  |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Coherence**    | Improved significantly with structured prompts.           |
| **Creativity**   | Tail generation + semantic filters enhanced storytelling. |
| **Accuracy**     | Fact-check prompting improved report reliability.         |
| **Tone & Style** | Controlled through semantic filters (formal/creative).    |

---

## **Deliverables Summary**

* **First Draft:** Generated using simple prompts.
* **Refined Content:** Improved through advanced prompting patterns.
* **Multiple Versions:** Showed how prompts influence quality and structure.
* **Final Version:** Polished report and story.

---

## **Conclusion**

Using structured prompting techniques, AI models can produce clear, coherent, and creative content. Prompt patterns such as query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, and tail generation significantly enhance the quality, accuracy, and depth of generated reports, stories, and case studies. This experiment demonstrates the importance of prompt design in achieving high-quality outputs.

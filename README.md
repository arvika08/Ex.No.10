# **Ex. No. 10 – Content Creation (Reports, articles, case studies etc) Using Prompt Patterns**

## **Aim**

To demonstrate how prompting techniques—query decomposition, decision-making, answer engineering, semantic filtering, fact-checking, and tail generation—can be used to create high-quality content such as reports, articles, case studies, and creative writing using AI tools.

---

# **Procedure**

## **1. Study of Prompt Patterns**

The following prompt patterns were explored:

* **Query Decomposition:** Break a complex goal into smaller tasks.
* **Decision-Making:** Allow the AI to choose between options.
* **Answer Engineering:** Shape structure, tone, and output format.
* **Semantic Filtering:** Control style, tone, creativity, formality.
* **Fact-Check List:** Ensure factual accuracy.
* **Tail Generation:** Extend content with deeper insights.
* **Menu Actions:** Provide multiple actions for the AI to choose.

---

## **2. Selecting the Content Types**

Two scenarios were chosen:

1. **Business Report on Market Trends**
2. **Creative Writing – Sci-Fi Short Story**

---

## **3. Creating the Prompts**

Prompts were built in **layers**, starting simple and becoming more advanced using the above patterns.

```

---

# **FINAL STORY OUTPUT (Refined)**

# **The Last Signal**

## **Opening Scene**

The year was 2300. Captain Mira Patel sailed through the Orion Belt aboard *Starlight-9*.
The void was quiet—too quiet—until a pulse hit her sensors.

It was rhythmic.
Almost… alive.

---

## **Rising Action**

The signal led Mira to a silver sphere floating in space, perfectly symmetrical, reflecting distant nebulae.

As she approached, the hull vibrated like a heartbeat.

---

## **Discovery**

The sphere opened like a mechanical flower, projecting holographic memories—cities burning, oceans rising, and humanity fleeing Earth.

These weren’t visions of the past.

They were messages from a **future timeline** where Earth had already fallen.

---

## **Plot Twist**

The signal wasn’t a warning.

It was a *second chance*.

The sphere contained blueprints—technology humanity had never seen.

---

## **Resolution**

Mira turned her ship around.

She carried hope in the form of light.

---

## **Epilogue – The World That Followed**

Her return changed everything.
Earth avoided collapse.
Humanity unified and rebuilt.

Generations later, children studied the story of the **captain who answered the last signal**.

And saved their future.
